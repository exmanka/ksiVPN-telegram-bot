The number of VPN connections is also unlimited within reason! And additional bot functions will be available.\n\n💬 <b>How does the connection work?</b>\nIn the question-answer mode, the BOT learns the necessary information from you, sends instructions and configuration. You need to download the application from the official store (PlayMarket or App Store) and, following the instructions, add the configuration (usually you just need to scan the QR code).\n\n💬 <b>Is the subscription price fixed?</b>\nNo, the cost of a subscription depends on its type, there are several of them. For example, a discounted subscription is available to testers and some others. The final subscription price will be displayed after entering the referral promo code.\n\n💬 <b>Are ChatGPT-type services available with this VPN?</b>\nAlways available! Do not forget to specify their use when answering the bot's questions when creating the configuration.\n\n💬 <b>Which operating systems are supported?</b>\nThe service is available on all possible operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux.\n\n💬 <b>Which servers are provided?</b>\nThere are currently four servers available:\n1.
